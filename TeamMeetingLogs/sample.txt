Monday 11/4 Meeting #2
- This week we worked on the login page, registration page, discover page, header, footer and my closet. 
- We were able to make a basic outline for all of these pages, and start linking them together. 
- Our docker wasn't working completely during the meeting, however we were able to demo our code and get our docker working later. 
- Our plan for next week is to finish up the html files, and start working on functionalities of our project.
